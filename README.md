# javascript-dom-events
After the previous assignments I didn't really understand what Javascript was about but after this one I'm starting to get an better understanding
I made the snake game, it might not look design wise bit it works! 
Start using the arrows on your keyboard to start 
The snake is the green one and his food is red 
If the snake eats himself it's game over
If the snake goes out of the box it's game over
You can also push the button below the canvas to get a different message
I also made the header switch out two different texts and act like a typewriter
Of course I couldn't have done anything without watching bunch of tutorials on this!!
